## MISSION

To empower individuals *(makers, hobbyists, robotics enthusiasts, students, etc.)* and organizations *(Schools, Universities, Integrators, etc.)* to build advanced mobile robotics systems (`hardware` or `simulation`) leveraging open-source frameworks such as **ROS2** and **Arduino**, and **AI** through simplified `solutions`, `tools`, `development` and `learning` processes.
<br/>
<br/>
**robocre8** aims to revolutionize the field of advanced mobile robotics by easing the process of learning and building it (**Hardware** and **Simulation**)
<br/>
<br/>
**robocre8** also aims to ensure the longevity and future of open-source robotics in Nigeria, Africa, and the world by aiding the learning and building of advanced mobile robots.
<br/>
<br/>
From Nigeria to Africa, and the World!

## SOLUTIONS / PRODUCTS

**MOBO-BOT:**
<br/>
an open-source differential drive ROS2-based educational robot (similar to the popular Turtlebot, Andino bot, limo robot, etc.) to learn advanced mobile robotics concepts such as `control`, `sensor-fusion`, `localization`, `navigation`, `perception`, `Artificial Intelligence`, etc.

**EPMC Module (Easy PID Motor Controller):**
<br/>
easy-to-use open-source hardware for precise speed control of any geared DC motor that uses a quadrature encoder. This product is essential and relevant in robotic applications as precise control is currently a non-negotiable aspect of any modern robotic system.

<br/>

**EIMU Module (Easy IMU):**
<br/>
easy-to-use open-source advanced 9-axis IMU system based on the MPU9250 IMU. It includes features like easy calibration, configuring to use in any preferred reference frame (ENU, NED, and NWU), and providing accurate filtered ready-to-use orientation readings using the Madgwick filter.

## SERVICES

**Robotics Consulting Services:**
<br/>
Providing technical support/customized training to students, researchers, organizations, etc. who want to build and develop real robots or robot simulations in ROS2.
(we help optimize the robot development processes to effectively reduce time and costs)
<br/>

**Robotic Project Designs:**
<br/>
Design and develop mobile robot simulation in ROS2. Also, hardware integration, embedded control, and system architecture design for mobile robots in ROS2.
<br/>

**Robotics Tutorials:**
<br/>
Do you need a private or workshop tutor to learn mobile robotics using ROS2?
You're in luck and the right place.
